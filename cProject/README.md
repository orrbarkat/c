this is the how to work on the project:

1. git clone/pull
2. work on the file
** make sure you have no conflicts
3. git add file1, file2 ...
4. git commit -m "what ever you have to say"
5. git push origin master
6. happy coding!


TODO:
1. headers
2. there are some strings inside the code
3. the code has some "TODO" inside...
4. if config->spLoggerfilename is stdout it needs to print to stdout  
5. free new struct (sorting point) allocation in kd array init
6. make file needs adaptation?
